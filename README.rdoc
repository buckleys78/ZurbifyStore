== README

Author: Steve Buckley

This site is the result of following a demo to see how use of Zurb Foundation's 'foundation-rails' gem
works as a front-end framework with Rails.

No collaboration on this project.

Questions:  
1)why does the stylesheet layouts.css.scss keep changing to layouts.css.scss.css ???
2) how does this stylesheet with label.right connect to class: "right inline"line in small-3 columns class?
